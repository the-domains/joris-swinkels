  Together with a team of trainers, coaches and ambassadors I wake up the World.
  We facilitate 4 day processes to guide people to a "new level of
  Consciousness". A clear purpose, meaning. It's described as coming home to
  one's Self. The next episode of leadership, entrepreneurship and world
  structures is knocking at the door, how long do you try to keep up the old
  structure? Or are you ready for the next level?
